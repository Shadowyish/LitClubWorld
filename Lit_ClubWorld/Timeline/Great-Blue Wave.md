Once, far in the past, further still than the formation of the [[Sunken Isles]], there existed a world of joy and hope. This world was destroyed, by a cataclysmic flood, a great wave of water pouring from an unknown source. These waters wiped life, cities, peoples, and whole races from the planet. This was the Great-Blue Wave. The [[Sunken Isles]] were founded around this time, a series of taller landforms, that survived only because of the quick thought and selflessness of the great [[Titans]]. The [[Titans]] linked arms, and held the Great-Blue Wave at bay, protecting the remaining walkable land from being completely destroyed. Thus were the Sunken Isles born, and the races remaining on their surface, the only creatures left alive from the great cataclysm.
