The God of the Isles, and protector of ancient life. After the [[Great-Blue Wave]] and the [[Titans]] vaunted saving of the [[Sunken Isles]], Möthe'Ra organized the various remaining forms of divinity in order to help and develop the Isles. Möthe'Ra was later betrayed by one of their own, [[Vir'al]], who killed Möthe'Ra, causing the events of [[Mothe'Ra's Fall]]. The body of Möthe'Ra still exists today, in the remnants of [[Moth's Moss]], an Island formed from the decomposing remains of Möthe'Ra. Some whisper of Möthe'Ra's return, or continued existence, but no definitive proof has been seen of any direct actions taken by Möthe'Ra, since his body crashed into the seas so very long ago. The entity is enigmatic. Only the other gods may say if Möthe'Ra still exists...
