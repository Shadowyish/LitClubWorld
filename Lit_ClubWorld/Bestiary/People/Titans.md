Creatures of Ice and Solitude. When the world got hit by the [[Great-Blue Wave]] the Titans locked arms and created a [[Ice Wall|great wall]], saving the [[Sunken Isles]] from becoming a watery grave. They are not infallible however, every 200 years a tsunami occurs as a Titan falls, destroying a section of the [[Ice Wall]] before another can take it's place. They reproduce through a process similar to Mitosis.
