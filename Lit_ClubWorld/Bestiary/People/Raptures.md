Petrivorous dinosaurs that hollow out and eat rocks during their larval stage. Once they reach maturity they go through a metamorphosis, taking a form similar in size and shape as a great eagle. They are prone to mountainous terrain and are native to the [[Desolate Crag]]. Though they have retreated to the [[Edge Mountains]] after the [[The Fire Flood of 475]] during the [[Time of Repose]].
